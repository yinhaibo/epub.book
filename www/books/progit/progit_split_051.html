<p class="calibre3">So far, I've covered the basics of how Git works and how to use it, and I've introduced a number of tools that Git provides to help you use it easily and efficiently. In this chapter, I'll go through some operations that you can use to make Git operate in a more customized fashion by introducing several important configuration settings and the hooks system. With these tools, it's easy to get Git to work exactly the way you, your company, or your group needs it to.</p>
