<h2 class="calibre4" id="calibre_pb_40">Summary</h2>

<p class="calibre3">You have several options to get a remote Git repository up and running so that you can collaborate with others or share your work.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Running your own server gives you a lot of control and allows you to run the server within your own firewall, but such a server generally requires a fair amount of your time to set up and maintain. If you place your data on a hosted server, it's easy to set up and maintain; however, you have to be able to keep your code on someone else's servers, and some organizations don't allow that.</p>

<p class="calibre3">It should be fairly straightforward to determine which solution or combination of solutions is appropriate for you and your organization.</p>
